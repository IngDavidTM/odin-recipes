    <p>Learn the secret to making the best homemade French fries from russet potatoes right at home! These are easy to make ahead of time and fry or bake in the oven for a quick snack or side dish idea!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Russet potatoes/person</li>
        <li>Cold water</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>
        <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>
        <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
    </ol>
